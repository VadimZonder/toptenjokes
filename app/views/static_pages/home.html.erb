                        <br>  <br>
                        <p>In 1518 in the Roman city of Strasbourg, 
                        hundreds of people came down with “dancing mania,” where they danced for days on end and seemed unable to stop. 
                        Some of the dancers kept going until they died from exhaustion, strokes, and heart attacks. 
                        Experts say it may have been a form of mass hysteria. The event became known as the “Dancing Plague of 1518.”</p> 
                            <br> 
                        <p>This wasn’t the only case of groups of people being affected by dancing mania. 
                        There were a number of outbreaks that happened in Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries.
                        Medical historians say it was likely a form of mass hysteria caused by extreme stress combined with the belief that they were being forced to dance.</p> 
                         <br>
                        <p>For instance in Strasbourg, there was a local belief that St. Vitus, the patron saint of dancers, would curse people and force them to dance. 
                        Others explanations at the time included that the dancers were possessed, or that the dancing was brought on by spider bites. 
                        When 400 hundred people joined in the dancing in Strasbourg, officials tried to help but probably contributed to the problem. 
                        They assumed people just needed to get the dancing out of their systems, so they set up halls for the dancers with musicians and professional dancers to help out.</p>

                        <p>In 75 BCE, Julius Caesar was captured and ransomed by pirates who didn’t realize who he was. 
                        The whole time he was their captive, he bossed them around. 
                        From time to time, he also warned them he would have them crucified. 
                        The pirates assumed he was crazy. But after he was released, he came back to capture the pirates and then crucified them.</p> 
                         <br>  
                        <p>Caesar was 25-years old and traveling to study in Rhodes when he was captured by the pirates. 
                        When he learned the pirates were asking for a ransom of 20 talents for his release, he laughed and suggested they ask for 50. 
                        Throughout his captivity, he refused to act like a prisoner. He bossed them around and shushed them when he wanted to sleep.
                        He also made them listen to the speeches and poems he was working on. 
                        Whenever the pirates weren’t impressed by his writings, he said they were too stupid to appreciate them.</p> 


 <br> <br>
                        <p>The ransom was delivered after 38 days and Caesar was released. 
                        He then gathered a naval force and went back to the island where he had been held captive. 
                        He found the pirates were still there and captured them. 
                        Later, when the governor of Asia seemed hesitant to punish the pirates, Caesar personally went to the prison and had them all crucified. </p>

                        <p> In the 1820s, John Quincy Adams approved an expedition to the center of the Earth. 
                        Part of the plan was to meet the race of people living inside the earth and to conduct trade with them.</p> 
                        <br>  
                        <p>The proposal was made by an American army officer named John Cleves Symmes, Jr. He had been touring the country and giving lectures about his theory of a hollow Earth. 
                        He believed the Earth was made up of several spheres, and that there were openings at the North and South poles that could be used to get inside the Earth and explore 
                        its hollow interior. So, he planned to take one hundred men to the Arctic and use sleighs pulled by reindeer to travel to the North pole and enter into the Earth.  
                        He also believed that there could be a race of people living inside the Earth, and part of his plan for the expedition was to establish trade with them. </p> 
                        


 <br>
                        <p>The theory was considered laughable by most people, but when Symmes lobbied the government to fund his expedition, John Quincy Adams said yes. 
                        However, Adams’ term in office ended before the plan was carried out. Once Andrew Jackson became president, he put a stop to the plan.

                        <p>In 1698, when King Charles XII of Sweden was 16, he became known for throwing wild, drunken parties and going out into the streets to cause havoc.
                        One night he went running through the streets of Stockholm, yanking hats and wigs off of people’s heads. </p> 
                        <br>  
                        <p>In the summer of 1698, Charles’ cousin, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, visited Stockholm to marry the king’s sister. 
                        The duke was ten years older than the king and seemed to have a bad influence on him. 
                        The pair committed a variety of outrageous acts that summer and it became known as the “Gottorp Fury.” 
                        Their antics included throwing furniture out of the palace windows, 
                        throwing cherry pits at the king’s ministers, and taking a group of young people through the streets to wreak havoc. </p> 

 <br>
                        <p>The young king finally toned down his behavior after a bear was killed at one of his parties. 
                        The bear had been forced to drink wine, and then it fell out of a window.
                        When it happened, Charles vowed never to drink strong alcohol again. 
                        With only a few exceptions, he kept his vow until his death in 1718.

                        <p>In 1921, the 15-year-old former emperor of China, Puyi, decided he wanted to have a phone installed in the palace for his personal use.
                        His advisors tried to keep him from getting one because they were afraid it would give him too much independence since Puyi usually had no contact with the outside world. 
                        But when he finally got his phone, he just used it to make prank calls.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>Puyi was the last emperor of China. He lost his title when the Empire was abolished in 1912. 
                        After that, he became a symbolic leader and still lived in the Imperial Palace. </p> 


 <br> 
                        <p>Puyi learned about telephones from one of his tutors and decided he wanted one. 
                        At first, his advisors told him it was a bad idea because it would go against tradition. 
                        Later, they had his father tell him that giving outsiders the ability to call into the palace’s inner sanctum would hurt imperial dignity. 
                        But in his autobiography, Puyi said the real reason they tried to stop him was that they were afraid of 
                        what would happen once he had contact with the outside world since he had been confined to the palace since he was a young child.</p> 

 <br>
                        <p>Once Puyi got his phone, he used a Beijing telephone directory to start making prank phone calls. 
                        He called a famous opera singer in Beijing and then giggled and hung up. 
                        Several times he called restaurants and had large meals sent to random addresses.

                        <p>During the heat of the space race in the 1960's, NASA quickly discovered that ballpoint pens would not work in the zero gravity confines of its space capsules. 
                        After considerable research and development, the Astronaut Pen was developed at a cost of $1 million. 
                        The pen worked in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, on almost any surface including glass and also enjoyed some modest success as a novelty item back here on earth.
